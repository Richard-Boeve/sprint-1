Command Line: It's another way to operate your computer. Instead of the usual grahical interface, you drive the computer using text commands.
mkdir - Create a new directory or folder
ls - Display a list of all files you have in your current directory
touch - create a new file in your current directory
cd - change directory, this command is followed by the name of the directory that you want to go too (which must be part of the directory you are currently in)
pwd - displays the full directory path you are currently in
exit - closes the terminal
git - if you want to give a command that applies to git you have to prefix it with 'git '
git add - adds a file to your staging, ie makes it visible to git so it knows it can commit this (once told so)
git commit - creates a snapshot of the directory in your local repositry, meaning this point in time is saved and can be reverted to. 
git push - the local repository is uploaded to Github
